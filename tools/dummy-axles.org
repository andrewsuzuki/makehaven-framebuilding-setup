#+TITLE: Dummy Axles

[[./dummy-axles.png]]

Space and index the dropouts throughout the framebuilding process, and provide a connection point to various fixtures.

QR rear dummy axles are 2mm oversized to account for heat distortion (typically inwards). TA dummy axles and QR front dummy axles are exact.

QR dummy axles typically have a .75" OD. TA dummy axles typically have a 1" OD.

Front dummy axles have a 1.375" wide middle section. Rear dummy axles have a 2.5" wide middle section.

* Materials

303 stainless round

** Cost

- .75": 636 total internal lengths + 5*(2.92*2 indexers + 10 kerf) = 715.2 (28.2")
  - washers: 5*(4+parting tool kerf)*2 = TODO
  - buy 7/8", 29" =$43= (MSS)
- 1": 600 total internal lengths + 5*(2.92*2 indexers + 10 kerf) = 679.2 (26.8")
  - buy 1.125", 28" =$63= (MSS)
- M6 x 20 SHCS x20 =$6=

Total: $112

* Fabrication

Turn most of it on the lathe. Make a custom fixture to hold them vertically in the mill to machine the end indexers.

The square shoulder for the middle section should retain the small fillet from the turning tool (likely 1/16" radius). The accepting tools will have a chamfer or similar relief to provide clearance.

The actual middle width is .003" oversized.

TODO washers (cost + fab)
TODO longer TA shoulder-washers? (see farr photo)
