** Cost

$25

* Fabrication

Waterjet, then drill and tap hole in top for bolt.

Two clamps can fit in a 4x5" piece of plate, so the total area used is about 8x5" (or 4x10").

The end of the bolt should be turned down to a point.

* TODO

Plan other types of braze-on clamps (reacher, special cases).
